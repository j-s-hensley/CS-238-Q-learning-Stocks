# CS 238 : Buying and Selling Stock with Q-Learning

Authors : Sarah Hensley

Abstract : Finding  a  strategy  to  invest  in  and  profit  from  the stock
market is a problem of great interest. We apply Q-learning to  stock  prices  
from  Alphabet,  training  on  data  from  the  years2013  -  2017  and  testing
on  2018.  While  the  learned  policies perform  well  on  the  training  
data,  they  perform  poorly  on  the test  data.  This  is  likely  indicative
of  vastly  different  behavior  in Alphabetâ€™s  stock  between  the  two  time  
periods.
